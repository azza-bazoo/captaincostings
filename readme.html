All figures are in millions of dollars over the forward estimates (2013-2017).


Most of the figures have been taken from <a href="http://lpaweb-static.s3.amazonaws.com/2013%2009%2005%20TABLE.pdf">the Liberal Party&#8217;s costings document</a>, <a href="http://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2013/09/05/final-update-federal-coalition-election-policy-commitments">published yesterday</a> (5 September 2013). Sadly, most mainstream news reporting of the document has done a poor job conveying the scale of all the different measures.

Labor have published <a href="http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/1746/attachments/original/1378268006/2013_ALP_measures_list.pdf?1378268006">an equivalent document</a>, but it lists policies that are relatively cheap; all of the major multi-billion-dollar commitments were in the <a href="http://www.budget.gov.au">May budget</a>.


What's not included?
<ul>
<li>The Liberal document claims a $1.1bn &#8220;dividend from stopping the boats&#8221;. While this is a reasonable sum for reduced spending on border patrols, it&#8217;s not clear that one side will actually stop boat arrivals any more than the other, especially since their policies are so similar.</li>
<li>**** Labor has proposed a supplemental job-seeker allowance, which the Liberal document will cancel for $1.1bn in savings, but details have not been released by either side???<li>
<li>The Gonski school funding package <a href="">has been agreed to by both parties</a>.</li>
<li>Likewise, some projects have equal funding from both sides even though one or the other has made a bigger deal out of it. For instance, the Pacific Highway upgrade and Gateway WA projects have equal funding commitments up to 2017.</li>
</ul>
