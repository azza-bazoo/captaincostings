## Captain Costings

A little web infographic about election campaign costings.

### What are your sources?

Most of the figures are taken from [the Liberal Party&#8217;s costings document](http://lpaweb-static.s3.amazonaws.com/2013%2009%2005%20TABLE.pdf), published [on 5 September](http://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2013/09/05/final-update-federal-coalition-election-policy-commitments).

Labor have published [an equivalent document](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/1746/attachments/original/1378268006/2013_ALP_measures_list.pdf?1378268006), but it lists policies that are relatively cheap; all of the major multi-billion-dollar commitments were in the [May budget](http://www.budget.gov.au).

### What&#8217;s not included?

Many election promises are too small, in the scheme of the $375 billion Federal budget, to be worth displaying.

Only the differences between parties are shown; for instance, the Gonski school funding package is now [agreed to by both parties](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/02/tony-abbott-embraces-gonski-schools). Likewise, some infrastructure projects have close to equal funding from both sides, even though one or the other has made a bigger fuss about it.

Broadband is a big (and expensive) policy difference between the parties, but the Liberal costings obscure their expected savings in amongst other public debt, so it&#8217;s been left out for simplicity.

The Liberal document also claims a $1.1bn &#8220;dividend from stopping the boats&#8221;, but it&#8217;s not clear that one side will actually stop boat arrivals any more than the other, especially since their policies are so similar.

I&#8217;m [Hourann Bosci](http://hourann.com) ([@daBosq on Twitter](http://twitter.com/daBosq)). I am not affiliated with any party, but am disappointed at the less-than-clear media coverage of each party&#8217;s spending, so I rushed this out the night before.
